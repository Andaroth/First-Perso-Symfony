#Symfony
=======

A Symfony project created on February 2, 2018, 8:41 am. Goal is to understand how and why using Symfony. It will also improve my MVC mindset and also my skills so I will rule at my internship. 

Note that I'm locally using a Vhost (axel.dev) to access /web folder. 


- The `homePageBundle` is a folder for testing what I learn on OpenClassroom (where french code's parts are from, sorry for not being sorry). 

- My learning folder is `PlatformBundle`. 
Folders' names are due to OC's course instructions. 

## homePageBundle

First I set up the routers with multiple pages responses including a 404.
Then I insert some .php pages from another project (fil rouge at BeCode.org) and then made it fit to the framework. 
This implied to move assets to /web folder.
