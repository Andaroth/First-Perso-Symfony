# My first Symfony project

## About this project

Created on February 2, 2018, 8:41 am. 

Goal is to understand how and why using Symfony. It will also improve my MVC mindset and also my skills so I will rule at my internship. 

Note that I'm locally using a vhost (axel.dev) to access /web folder but it doesn't change anything for you. 

## About the content

### OC\homePageBundle

- The `homePageBundle` is where I apply what I learnt in OpenClassroom (see *OC\PlatformBundle*), mostly without the doc for memory rising purposes. 

First I have configured the routers so it can return multiple pages including a 404. 

Then I've inserted some .php pages from another project (fil rouge at BeCode.org, see *The Front-End*) and then made it fit to the framework. 
This implied to move assets to /web folder. 

#### The Front-End

I'm keeping copying html files from a BeCode's group project, which is now in Symfony too (So I can say that I can 'project to Symfony' and 'Symfony to project' lol). 
[The group's repo is here](https://github.com/Andaroth/fil-rouge-Folo-The-Source) if you want to check our group's commits. 

### OC\PlatformBundle

- `PlatformBundle` is a testing folder. 

I'm following [OpenClassroom's Symfony course](https://openclassrooms.com/courses/developpez-votre-site-web-avec-le-framework-symfony/), feeling free to take some liberties. 

Work in progress is in this folder.
